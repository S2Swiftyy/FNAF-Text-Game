# FNAF-Text-Game
Text based rendition of Five Night's at Freddy's coded in C++.
Night 1 is the only currently working night.
Only Freddy is active on Night 1 and more animatronics will be introduced on later nights.
As you progress to later nights, the animatronics will be more likely to move towards you and less likely to move away, energy will be more costly so you need to use it wisely, and the animatronics will move more often.

PATCH NOTES (ONLY UPDATED FROM 0.1.2 AND ON)

V0.1.2

Tweaked the way movement works, added a system in which animatronics are more likely to move back to the dining room if they have tried to kill you so that they don't camp in the hallway


V0.2.0

Added Night 2

Bonnie now gets active

Reworked Freddy movement to make Night 1 a bit easier now that difficulty scales with night

Updated map

Added new location on the map "SUPPLY" that Bonnie hide in 

Fixed a bug that caused a crash when user tried to select a night that was not unlocked 



V0.2.1

Updated the Bonnie jump scare so now it has an "animation" when Bonnie kills you

Added "bonnie_scare.txt" to file list, this is just the text file containing the image of bonnie's jumpscare for the program to read from

# FNAF-Text-Game
Text based rendition of Five Night's at Freddy's coded in C++.
Night 1 is the only currently working night.
Only Freddy is active on Night 1 and more animatronics will be introduced on later nights.
As you progress to later nights, the animatronics will be more likely to move towards you and less likely to move away, energy will be more costly so you need to use it wisely, and the animatronics will move more often.
